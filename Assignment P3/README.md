# EEDS Assignment P2

This is a continuation of the first assignment which was based on the jupyter notebooks which can be found in this [folder.](https://github.com/gentrexha/energy_efficient_ds/tree/master/Assignment%20P1/notebooks)

## Tasks
- [ ] Present your simulation infrastructure; Make a flow chart (or similar) diagram that describes your approach to the problem;
- [ ] Present how do you intend to perform needed observations (for example, how and where to observe forecast accuracy, how to decide which range of historical data points is needed). Justify your approach to iterative process of calculating ranges of data that give best forecast accuracy for used test data. *We do not expect more than 100 missing values in a gap.
- [ ] Select one data set and apply single forecast method on a gap length by choice, to find range of historical data that results generally in best forecast accuracy, according to your approach.
Show graph that describes behavior of forecast accuracy for different used historical data (preceding the gap) and showing selected/calculated amount necessary for chosen gap length. Illustrate/show corresponding steps/approaches/code etc. (*In order to apply selected forecasting method, maybe you will need to measure some characteristics, e.g., seasonality over data points before the gap. ([6-7] can provide techniques/methods for needed analysis). Briefly describe them if you used any.
- [ ] Send slides of given presentation with the subject: “EEDS Assignment P2”.
