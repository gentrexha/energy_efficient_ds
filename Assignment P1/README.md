# EEDS Assignment P1

## Tasks
- [x] Find two datasets (time series): 
	* preferably from IoT systems/sensors; 
	* if possible, both datasets should contain different characteristics (e.g., they can have seasonality, deterministic trend, stationary properties). ([1-3] might be a good starting point for checking.); 
	* show charts of selected datasets including related information such as dataset sources, metrics, range of values, size, number of data points, characteristics (volatility, mean) etc.
- [x] Select two forecasting methods/models you plan to use in your mechanism for adaptive recovery ([4-5] might be a good starting point for checking.); 
 * Briefly describe them.
- [x] Select one forecast accuracy measure that you will use for the forecast evaluation; 
	* Briefly describe this measure – no need for formula explanation.
- [x] Discuss and justify your implementation choices for programming language/framework, methodologies, libraries, packages, etc.
- [x] Prepare brief descriptions and justifications for all your selections with appropriate arguments;
- [ ] Send slides of given presentation with the subject: “EEDS Assignment P1”.
